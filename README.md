# Electroencephalogram-Signal-Classification-for-action-identification
It is a Convolution-based Neural Network to perform classification on Electroencephalogram signals captured when subjects were exposed to different stimuli. We train a model from scratch since such signal-classification models are fairly scarce in pre-trained format
